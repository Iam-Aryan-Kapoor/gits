Kurrent: Also known as deutsche Schrift or "German script", this cursive script was used for hundreds of years in German records.
It evolved from late medieval cursive writing and was adopted by many chancelleries because it was legible and fast to write. 
Kurrent was used in parallel with Latin cursive, depending on the context of the text. 

Sütterlin: A more angular type of Kurrent that was introduced in German schools in 1914. 
It was taught in all of Germany from 1934–1941, but was replaced by Latin handwriting in 1941
Sütterlin is characterized by simplified letters and vertical strokes.
